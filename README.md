# Clone-Wars
A Shooter game developed using C++ and Unreal Engine 4

An action packed TPP shooter game. The player finds himself in an evil lab where many of his clones are made. His objective is to eliminate all the clones.

This project is made in Unreal Engine 4 with C++. The world and character assets used here are a free download from GameDev. I was responsible for creating all the logics related to health, viewports, and damage. Creating the enemy behavior using the Behavior tree and hooked up the task and selector entity of the Behavior tree with the C++ code and used the nav mesh for enemy follow up to player location. Also tried my hand at attaching different animation and creating state machine.
